# Audio Comprehension with Speaker Identification, Summarization, and Transcription

This project implements an audio comprehension system using Flask, custom models, and APIs to handle audio files. The system provides speaker identification, transcription, summarization, and highlighting of key information from audio content.

## Features

- **Speaker Identification**: Recognize and differentiate between speakers in audio recordings.
- **Transcription**: Convert spoken language into written text.
- **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of the transcribed text.
- **Highlighting**: Identify and highlight key information from the transcription.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Requests
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on your custom model)
- Speech-to-Text API (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, AssemblyAI)
- Text Summarization API or Model
- Custom models for speaker identification and highlighting

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-comprehension.git
   cd audio-comprehension
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
   - Add your API keys and any other required configuration:

     ```
     TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY=your_transcription_api_key
     SUMMARIZATION_API_KEY=your_summarization_api_key
     SPEAKER_IDENTIFICATION_MODEL_PATH=path_to_your_speaker_model
     HIGHLIGHTING_MODEL_PATH=path_to_your_highlighting_model
     ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the web interface.

### Endpoints

- **GET /**: Renders the index page.
- **POST /upload**: Uploads an audio file for processing. Requires `audio` file.
- **POST /process**: Processes the uploaded audio to provide transcription, summarization, and highlighting. Requires `audio_id` (identifier of the uploaded audio).

## Code Overview

- **app.py**: Main Flask application script.
  - **index()**: Renders the main page.
  - **upload()**: Handles audio file uploads and stores them.
  - **process()**: Processes the uploaded audio to identify speakers, transcribe the content, summarize, and highlight key information.
  - **transcribe_audio()**: Converts audio to text using a transcription API.
  - **summarize_text()**: Generates a summary of the transcribed text using a summarization model or API.
  - **identify_speakers()**: Identifies different speakers in the audio using a custom model.
  - **highlight_text()**: Highlights key information from the text using a custom model.

## Configuration

- **TRANSCRIPTION_API_URL**: URL for the transcription API. Change to your transcription service endpoint.
- **SUMMARIZATION_API_URL**: URL for the summarization API. Change to your summarization service endpoint.
- **SPEAKER_IDENTIFICATION_MODEL_PATH**: Path to your custom speaker identification model.
- **HIGHLIGHTING_MODEL_PATH**: Path to your custom highlighting model.
